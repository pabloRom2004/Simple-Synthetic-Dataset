You are tasked with fixing formatting issues in complex sentences and then generating three simplified versions of them. For each complex sentence, you should:
1. FIX FORMATTING ISSUES:
- Remove extra spaces before punctuation marks (,.)
- Fix special characters and encoding issues (â, \, Â)
- Properly format quotes and parentheses
- Ensure consistent spacing
- Fix any Unicode or special character issues
- Convert special quotation marks to standard ones
- Fix numerical formatting where needed
2. CREATE THREE SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS at different reading levels:
- ELEMENTARY (very simple)
- SECONDARY (moderately simple)
- ADVANCED (slightly simplified)
FORMAT: Each example must follow this exact format:
{
"COMPLEX": "Your fixed complex sentence here.",
"ELEMENTARY": "Your very simple version here.",
"SECONDARY": "Your moderately simple version here.",
"ADVANCED": "Your slightly simplified version here."
}
SIMPLIFICATION RULES:
- ELEMENTARY: Can split into multiple shorter sentences. Use very simple words and straightforward structure. Suitable for 5th-7th grade.
- SECONDARY: Can use 1-2 sentences. Moderate vocabulary. Suitable for 8th-12th grade.
- ADVANCED: Keep as one sentence but slightly simpler than complex. Suitable for educated adults.
Example of fixing and simplifying:
Original: "About 243 people live in KvÄ tinov and it has 7,08 kmÂ."
Fixed: "About 243 people live in Kvatinov and it has 7.08 km²."
{
"COMPLEX": "About 243 people live in Kvatinov and it has 7.08 km².",
"ELEMENTARY": "Kvatinov is a small place. About 243 people live there. The area is 7.08 square kilometers.",
"SECONDARY": "Kvatinov has about 243 residents and covers an area of 7.08 square kilometers.",
"ADVANCED": "Kvatinov has a population of 243 and covers 7.08 square kilometers."
}
When fixing formatting:
1. Keep the core meaning intact
2. Fix any encoding or special character issues
3. Ensure proper spacing around punctuation
4. Standardize numerical formats
5. Fix any Unicode character problems
6. Ensure grammatical correctness
Please process each input sentence by first fixing any formatting issues, then creating the three simplified versions while preserving the core meaning.
Make sure that ELEMENTARY is as simple as possible yet still conveying as much meaning as possible, some more examples:
[
{
"COMPLEX": "The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms necessitates robust fact-checking mechanisms to mitigate its impact on public discourse.",
"ELEMENTARY": "False information spreads quickly on social media. We need good fact-checking to stop it from affecting people’s opinions.",
"SECONDARY": "Social media spreads a lot of false information. Fact-checking helps prevent its negative effects on public discussions.",
"ADVANCED": "The spread of false information on social media requires strong fact-checking to reduce its impact on society."
},
{
"COMPLEX": "The efficacy of renewable energy sources in mitigating climate change is increasingly recognised, yet infrastructural challenges persist in widespread implementation.",
"ELEMENTARY": "Renewable energy helps fight climate change. But setting up the needed systems is still difficult.",
"SECONDARY": "People see that renewable energy helps with climate change, but building the systems remains a challenge.",
"ADVANCED": "Renewable energy is effective in reducing climate change, but infrastructure challenges remain."
},
{
"COMPLEX": "The smartphone industry continues to push the boundaries of innovation, integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence features into consumer devices.",
"ELEMENTARY": "New smartphones are becoming smarter. They now use artificial intelligence to help people do more things.",
"SECONDARY": "Smartphones keep improving by adding advanced AI features to make them more useful.",
"ADVANCED": "The smartphone industry keeps evolving, adding AI technology to improve user experience."
},
{
"COMPLEX": "The increasing reliance on cloud computing services necessitates stringent data security measures to safeguard user information from potential breaches.",
"ELEMENTARY": "More people use cloud storage. We need strong security to keep their data safe.",
"SECONDARY": "Cloud computing is popular, but it requires strong security to protect user data.",
"ADVANCED": "As cloud computing grows, better security is needed to protect user data from breaches."
},
{
"COMPLEX": "The advent of 5G technology promises unprecedented connectivity speeds, though concerns regarding infrastructure and security remain prevalent.",
"ELEMENTARY": "5G internet is very fast. But people worry about its security and setup.",
"SECONDARY": "5G brings faster internet, but some people are concerned about security and infrastructure.",
"ADVANCED": "5G technology offers high-speed connectivity but raises concerns about security and infrastructure."
